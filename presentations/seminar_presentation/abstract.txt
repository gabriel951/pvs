TITLE: Functional Nominal C-Unification
ABSTRACT:  Nominal syntax extends first-order syntax by bringing mechanisms to deal 
with bound and free variables in a natural manner. However, profiting from the nominal
paradigm implies adapting basic notions such as substitution, rewriting and equality
to it. 
Recent work presents advances in nominal unification modulo equational theories. In this field, 
there is the problem of nominal unification with commutative operators. We revisit
this problem, specify a functional algorithm for the task and discuss its
formalization. This is a work in progress, with Mauricio Ayala-Rincon.
