\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

% conclusion
\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
    Nominal C unification was explained (hopefully) and an algorithm was presented.
\end{frame}

% future work 
\begin{frame}{Future Work}
    Future work:  
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Use a proof verification system to verify soundness and completeness of
            nominal C unification algorithm for nominal terms.
        \item Extend algorithm for A and AC unification and verify its correctness in
            a proof verification system. 
    \end{itemize}
