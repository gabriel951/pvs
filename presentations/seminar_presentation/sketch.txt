2. Nominal C Unification - Proposed algorithm (estimated time: )
3. Future work  (estimated time: )

Possible questions 
1. Why is nominal syntax useful?
2. Why is unification useful?
3. Why is extending nominal unification to commutative symbols useful?
4. Why is verifying this on PVS useful?

Interesting Comments 
1. Introduction
-> Nominal C-Unification is in the field of unification modulo equational theories. 
-> Where is unification useful? lambda-calculus beta reduction rules are a nice
example
