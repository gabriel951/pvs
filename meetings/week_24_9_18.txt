Before the meeting
    - I run Ana Cristina proves again, I think they are correct. I discovered a way
      to run them on automatic, but i did not run them on my computer. 
      How to know whether they are correct?
    - I started reading Washington article. The bound obtained for commutative
      operators seemed suspicious because it appears to disagree with Baader book... 
    - can i be dismissed of summer school?
    - when can i present the research i have been doing in the seminar? 

After the meeting 
    - Specification appear to be ok. 
    - I read the wrong Washington article. Must read nominal C-unification next time
    - Search the article on Capes Newspaper next time
    - I don't need to take classes in summer school. I should present something new
      by 23/11. 
    - He explained to me more about Washington research
