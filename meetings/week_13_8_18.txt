# Before the meeting
I did not met Ayala last week, so this is the same as last week 
-> Read article on nominal rewriting...
-> I did the leveling test and got into advanced I... 
-> I have not started the polynomial unification algorithm article.
-> I should ask if I can use LaForce

# After the meeting 
-> I can use LaForce :) 
-> I must find some time in the week to meet with him - ok, i've already emailed.
