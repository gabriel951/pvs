Before the Meeting
# Things i should have said for the meeting of 10/12
-> I needed to make sure to put a restrictive on the type of parameters commutative
functions receive: they must receive pairs. 
-> I am convinced that commutative function should receive two arguments, instead of
a pair. I don't want a commutative function being called with f(a, b, c). 
    Ex: f(a, b, c) = f(f(a, b), c) = f(d, c) = e 
        f(a, b, c) = f(a, f(b, c)) = f(a, x) = y
    * a pair can be used to pass more than 2 arguments to a function! This shouldn't
      be possible with a commutative function. 
-> How should i extend the function less to handle fixpoint equations? My first try
is to see if one set of fixpoint equations is contained in the other set. This does
not take into account substitutions applied on set of fixpoint equations...
-> I was able to add pair as a subtype. Then, i can define a commutative function to
take a pair. But i don't think this is the right approach. This approach also clutter
the notation.

# Thing i should say as the meeting of 10/12
-> The code is typechecked :) 
-> I am beggining the proof

After the Meeting 
-> I should finish the specification according to the paper of Washington
