Before the Meeting
- Started adapting the algorithm for it to take into account fixpoint equation
- Coded one auxiliar function, i am in the other but forgot to handle fixpoint
equation 
- There is lex 3 on nasalib
- I thought about the case of the commutative function receiving a variable... the
  algorithm must enforce it receives a pair 
- On the specification of alpha, function now needs to get a list of fixpoint
  equations

After the Meeting 
- I must think about how the fixpoint equations will be handled by the algorithm, on
  the case of a pair.
- Try unifying h(f(s0, s1), s0) = h(f(t0, t1), t0) where h is not-commutative, but f
  is commutative. Look at Washington example. 
- We tried to solve the equation from the last example of Washington article... we
  missed the order of the swappings, but after a while ayala fixed it. 
- The function should handle case of a commutative function with one argument, where
  this argument is a variable!! f(X) = f(s, t) is valid!!
- He asked me once again why the algorithm does not take simply a list of terms to
  unify
- Focus on the algorithm, not on the presentation
