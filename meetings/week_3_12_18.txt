Before the Meeting 
-> I needed to make sure to put a restrictive on the type of parameters commutative
functions receive: they must receive pairs. 
-> I am convinced that commutative function should receive two arguments, instead of
a pair. I don't want a commutative function being called with f(a, b, c). 
    Ex: f(a, b, c) = f(f(a, b), c) = f(d, c) = e 
        f(a, b, c) = f(a, f(b, c)) = f(a, x) = y
    * a pair can be used to pass more than 2 arguments to a function! This shouldn't
      be possible with a commutative function. 
-> How should i extend the function less to handle fixpoint equations? My first try
is to see if one set of fixpoint equations is contained in the other set. This does
not take into account substitutions applied on set of fixpoint equations...
-> I was able to add pair as a subtype. Then, i can define a commutative function to
take a pair 

After the Meeting
-> There was no meeting because Ayala think i should study for analysis exam
