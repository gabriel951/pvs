TITLE: Functional Nominal C-Unification
ABSTRACT:  Nominal syntax extends first-order syntax by bringing mechanisms to deal 
with bound and free variables in a natural manner. However, profiting from the nominal
paradigm implies adapting basic notions such as substitution, rewriting and equality
to it. 
Recent work presents advances in nominal unification modulo equational theories. In this field, 
there is the problem of nominal unification with commutative operators. We revisit
this problem, specify a functional algorithm for the task and discuss its
formalization. This is a work in progress, with Mauricio Ayala-Rinc√≥n. 


AFTER MODIFICATIONS
ABSTRACT:  Nominal syntax extends first-order syntax by bringing 
mechanisms to deal with bound and free variables in a natural manner. 
However, profiting from the nominal paradigm implies adapting basic 
notions such as substitution, rewriting and equational deduction to 
it. Extensions of nominal unification modulo equational theories are of 
great relevance. In this context, recent work deals with theories such 
as associativity (A) and commutativity (C). This work discuss the 
problem of nominal C-unification, that is, unification with commutative 
operators. The problem is revisited, discussing current progress on a 
new functional algorithm and its formalization.
