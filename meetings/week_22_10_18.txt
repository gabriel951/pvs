Before the Meeting
- Adapted function to behave like unify or unify_lst, according to a boolean
- Put documentation
- No need for function alpha? apparently
- Some auxiliary functions are missing: 4 of them, I guess
- I need to specify correclty soundness and completeness of the algorithm
- Where is lex2 defined and how will i use it? 
- Some TCC's are unproved 

After the Meeting 
- Did not handle the case of a commutative function properly with variable
- Solutions from the algorithm should include a list of fixpoint equations 
- Look prelude.pvs to see how ordinal was defined
- For function lex2, i could try lex2(lex2(), )
- I'll need to prove TCC's
- I should have the algorithm specified until 23/11
