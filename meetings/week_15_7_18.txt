So this is my first report on how my meetings with Ayala will proceed. Let's hope it
goes well! :) 

# Meeting date: 
# Before the meeting
    - Ayala accepted being my supervisor. Yay! :) 
    - I failed an analysis exam. So i'll have to study analysis next semester. But i
      think i can do research. 
    - I am thinking of taking the following classes next semester: 
        * theory of computing, computing seminar, <analysis 1> and one subject of
          algebra. What do you think?
    - I am reading the article on nominal rewriting. I am on page xx
    - Can I use the La force?

# Talk in meeting
- I forgot to ask about using the La Force
- Ayala told me to do only one subject (instead of two). So now I must decide between
  algebra, statistics and computing
- He will be traveling this week so I got some spare time
- I must do the niveling test
