In this week I should present to Ayala what I have done... But I have not finished
reading the articles he sent me... 

# Before the meeting
-> Read all the nominal rewriting article.
-> I did the leveling test and got into advanced I. 
-> I have not started the polynomial unification algorithm article.
-> I should ask if I can use LaForce

# After the meeting 
I did not met him
