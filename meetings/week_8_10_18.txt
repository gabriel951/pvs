Before the meeting
- I think I made a mistake in doing the specification of the commutative functions. 
- I corrected the mistake and was now in doubt on how to adapt only two functions in
  the entire .pvs world: alpha? and the unify algorithm. 
- I didn't read one article this week 

After the meeting
- Ayala said (and convinced me) that i did no mistake in the specification. 
- I'll need to change the specification of commutative function, so that it takes a
  pair. 
- For the function unify, now i'll need a sequence of correct solutions (context +
  substitution). He said it won't be necessary using a tree, a list is good enough.
