# Before the Meeting 
- I am now using substitutions as Ana Cristina defined 
- The code is not organized 
- I forgot to see the problem with Tiago 
- I proved 1/3 of soundness (the part of context) 
- I found a problem with my theorem. I should also garantee that the quadruple i am
  working with is consistent. 

# After the Meeting 
- See the problem with Tiago
- Curryfy some functions to make them clearer
