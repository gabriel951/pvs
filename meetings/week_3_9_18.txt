Before the Meeting
- I read Ana Cristina article
- Sent Calves an email, but message was not sent
- Started thinking about adapting PANU to the cases A and AC
    CASE A
        - no article found
        - naive algorithm that is exponential in the complexity of the term
    CASE AC 
        - did preliminary studies, should study more about this soon 
        - in a situation without constants, we can use linear programming to obtain a
          polynomial algorithm. But in a situation with constants... the problem is
          NP-complete 
        - Did not study the algorithm

- Study Unification A, C and AC for nominal theory
- Research calendar.
