# Before the Meeting
- Ayala asked me to refactor the specification in order to make it more elegant. i
  found a problem with this approach: when i use in the code the command that expand a
  definition i might get in trouble. So, I thought: i should finish the code with the
  workaround and then i can make it more elegant. 
- I am almost finishing the proof:
    * i finished the proof of the main theorems 
    * i need to extend Ana's lemmas to the case of commutative function symbols. I am
      currently in alpha-equivalence.pvs.  
    * i believe i can finish everything this week 
- I have workshop in the week 18-22. I was planning on finishing the proof this week
  and showing you the slides for the presentation next week.
