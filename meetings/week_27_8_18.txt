Meeting
- Explained about the article for Ayala. I think I could adapt him, but them it would
  have exponential cost. 
- X = pi * X, how fixed point equations should be handled?
- We talked about associative operators and the possibility of flattening


After the Meeting 
- think about adapting PANU to the cases A and AC.
- the research has a theme: extend A, C and AC unification to nominal theory.
