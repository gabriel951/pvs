# Before the Meeting
- Last meeting was on 17/12/18. So, there were two mondays without reunions. 
- In the last meeting we finished the remaining details about the specification. 
Show him how it is. 
- I proved the TCC's for the termination of the algorithm, but i didn't prove the 
preceding lemmas yet. There were some errors i made, so i fixed then
    * the lexicographic measure should consider the variables in P_lst U FP_lst, not
      only in P_lst
    * in one branch of the algorithm, i forgot to keep the original context. 
    * Warning: I changed the function Subs of Ana, to apply the first substitution in
      the head of the list 
- Comment about the specification
- I am planning on traveling this week to Patos de Minas 

# After the Meeting 
- I need to use the substitution as defined by Ana Cristina
- It would be good to organize the code to show Ayala next meeting
