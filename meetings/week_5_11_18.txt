Before the Meeting 
- I perceived the algorithm was wrong, the whole approach seemed wrong to me. I
  changed the design, in order for it to be closed to Washington's approach, thinking
in terms of trees. 
- I also viewed how to adapt the specification of soundness and completeness to take
  into account alpha equivalence UNDER a context Delta and UNDER a set of fixpoint
equations. 

After the Meeting
- I have to correct a few details on the algorithm 
- Ayala liked very much my progress 
- I have to make slides, study for presentation and fix a bit of the algorithm
